# GeothermalStockModelling
Definition of an Optimized Geothermal Utilization Strategy using Stock Reservoir Modelling as a Foundation

This model was created by Arkaitz Manterola Donoso for the Master Thesis named 'Sustainable Production Strategy Optimization using Stock Reservoir Modelling for Geothermal Power Plants. Case study: Bjarnarflag power station.' 

There are two main models to the code. A stock model and a production strategy model.

The first model will solve the main parameters required to describe a geothermal reservoir stock model. To do so, external data of the production wells will be requried. This model will be required as said main parameters will be then part of the initial inputs of the strategy model. 

The second model will create a production strategy focused on increasing the general revenue of the power plant while reducing the environmental impacts of the extraction (carbon emissions, excessive brine extraction and reservoir pressure drawdown)

**About the files in this repository:**

main.py will be the main code, which will run the rest of .py code.
